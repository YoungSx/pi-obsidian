/**
 * Static gate against the release version having a second home.
 *
 * `manifest.json` is the one place the plugin's version is allowed to live.
 * Obsidian reads it, the About tab renders it off `this.manifest.version`, and
 * `scripts/release.mjs` stamps it. Anything else that spells the version out is
 * a copy, and a copy drifts silently: nothing reads it back, so no test fails
 * and no reviewer notices.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `src/mcp/mcpManager.ts` reported
 * `{ name: "piem", version: "1.0.0" }` to every MCP server it connected to, and
 * kept reporting 1.0.0 while the plugin shipped 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 — the literal
 * was written once, on the day the file was created, and never touched again.
 * Both READMEs likewise told readers Piem was "in early alpha (0.1.0-alpha.x)"
 * a full major release later. The old `stamp-version.mjs` could not have caught
 * either one: it stamps a hardcoded list of three files, so a version number
 * appearing anywhere else is invisible to it by construction. Adding those two
 * files to the list would only move the next miss somewhere else.
 *
 * So the gate is inverted. Rather than enumerate where the version must be
 * written, it enumerates where it may be — `manifest.json`, `package.json`,
 * `versions.json` — and fails on a version-shaped literal anywhere else in the
 * shipped source or the docs.
 *
 * It is a gate, not a proof. A version assembled at runtime (`"1." + minor`) or
 * read from a map passes, because it cannot know what a computed value holds.
 * What it covers is the shape both real defects were written in: someone typing
 * today's version number directly into a file.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not a violation
 *
 * Most version-shaped strings in this repo are legitimate, and a gate that
 * flagged them would be switched off within a week:
 *
 * - **Other software's versions.** `minAppVersion`, a dependency's pin, or a
 *   protocol revision like MCP's `"2025-06-18"` name something that is not us.
 *   Only a literal matching the plugin's *own* current version is suspicious.
 * - **Test fixtures.** A test that hands a stub `"9.9.9-test"` or asserts on
 *   `describeVersion("0.1.0-alpha.7", …)` is pinning behaviour, not shipping a
 *   version. Test files are exempt wholesale.
 * - **Prose about a past release.** `AGENTS.md` and this file's own header cite
 *   old versions as history. Those are in comments and markdown prose, which is
 *   why the source scan looks at string literals through the parser rather than
 *   grepping lines, and the docs scan looks only for the *current* version.
