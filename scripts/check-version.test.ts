/**
 * Tests for the version-drift gate.
 *
 * A gate that passes proves nothing on its own. The rule this one enforces was
 * already implicit — `manifest.json` owns the version — and it passed every day
 * for two releases while `mcpManager.ts` reported a stale `1.0.0` to every MCP
 * server and both READMEs described a shipped 1.0.x plugin as early alpha.
 *
 * So what gets pinned here is the other direction: that a hand-written version
 * really does fail the gate, and — just as important — that the version-shaped
 * strings which are *supposed* to be there stay unflagged. A gate that fires on
 * `minAppVersion` or on a test's stub is a gate someone deletes from the CI
 * file, and then the rule is implicit again.
 *
 * Each case writes a scratch tree and runs the real script over it as a
 * subprocess, so what is under test is the shipped file rather than a
 * re-implementation of its logic. The scratch dir supplies its own
 * `manifest.json`, because the gate reads the current version from the file that
 * owns it and the assertions should not move on every release.

 * The subprocess's cwd is the scratch dir so `manifest.json` and the README
 * paths resolve there, while `node_modules` still resolves up to the repo for
 * the TypeScript parser.
