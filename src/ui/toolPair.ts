/**
 * Pairing a tool call with the result that answered it, so one invocation is one
 * row.
 *
 * The transcript used to draw two. `pi` delivers a call as a block inside an
 * assistant message and its result as a message of its own, and the renderer
 * followed that shape one row per message — so every tool the agent used printed
 * its name twice, once under a wrench that reports no status and once under a
 * tick that repeats the name to tell you the status. The reader scanning for what
 * the agent did counted every action twice, on a phone at two rows apiece, and
 * the two halves of the one thing they wanted to know — which note, and did it
 * work — sat in different rows, each with its own truncation.
 *
 * None of which the data required: `ToolCall.id` and `ToolResultMessage.toolCallId`
 * are the same string. This module reads that correspondence into a plan the
 * renderer can consult per row, on the model of `traceFold.ts`: computed once at
 * the top of `MessageList`, passed down, and each row asks it whether to draw
 * itself, draw itself plus a partner, or stand down.
 *
 * Free of React and DOM imports so the rules can be unit-tested without a
 * renderer.
 */

/**
 * Which call each result belongs to, both ways round.
 *
 * Two indexes rather than one because the renderer asks two questions from two
 * places: a call row asks "is my result in yet", and a result row asks "has my
 * call already spoken for me". Deriving the second from the first at render time
 * would mean a scan per result row.

 * transcript but not always immediately — a turn may issue three calls and then
 * report three results — so a single forward pass would have to hold unmatched
 * calls anyway.
 *
 * A call id is claimed exactly once. Two calls sharing an id (a session file
 * replayed from a build that generated them differently, a provider that reuses
 * ids across turns) leave the second one unpaired rather than showing the first
 * one's result twice: an unpaired call still says what it did, while a wrong
 * result says something that never happened.
 *
 * `ask_user` never pairs. Its call row is suppressed and its result renders as a
 * receipt of the reader's own decision, so a pairing would delete the receipt and
 * fold a human answer back into machine traffic.
